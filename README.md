# archTrain1
This is a simple repository for PoC of software architecture design exercises.

Considering my skills and knowledge, I am going to use the following technologies:
### Language: 
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
  - First, managing balance need the accuracy of the calculation. So static typing is good for this project.
  - This language is my first choice and most familiar one.
  - I think the static typing is important for development. So I chose it.
  - And I think this language is a good choice for unit testing.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - Also this language is my first choice for frontend development.
  - I chose this language because this language is familiar to me and this language is also statically typed.

### Liblaries and frameworks:

- Frontend:

  - [jwt](https://jwt.io/) as a token that  transports non-critical data between services
  - [Remix](https://remix.run/) as a frotend React-based framework
  - [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as a frontend UI framework

- Backend:  
  - [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) as a server-side framework
  - [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) as a web application framework
  - [ent](https://entgo.io/) as a ORM
  - [go-bps](https://pkg.go.dev/go.mercari.io/go-bps)
    - When considering basis point, I think this library is a good choice.
    - [reference article](https://engineering.mercari.com/blog/entry/20201203-basis-point/)

- Database:
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a database
    - I never used it, but I think it is a good choice for a database.

### Infrastructure:

- [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) as a reverse proxy
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as a containerization engine



# SuiiBell

An application for managing your balance.
First of all, this repository is for my own use.
But I am also going to share for others to use on their own computer by using on the Docker container.

This is a prototype, so when I complete the project, I will share the source code on the other github repository.
