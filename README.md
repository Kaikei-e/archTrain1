# archTrain1
This is a simple repository for PoC of software architecture design exercises.

Considering my skills and knowledge, I am going to use the following technologies:
### Language: 
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Liblaries and frameworks:

- Frontend:
  - [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) as a server-side framework
  - [jwt](https://jwt.io/) as a token that  transports non-critical data between services
  - [Remix](https://remix.run/) as a frotend React-based framework
  - [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as a frontend UI framework

- Backend:  
  - [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) as a web application framework
  - [ent](https://entgo.io/) as a ORM

- Database:
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a database
    - I never used it, but I think it is a good choice for a database

### Infrastructure:
- [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) as a reverse proxy
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) as a containerization engine

An application for managing your balance.
First of all, this repository is for my own use.
But I am also going to share for others to use on their own computer by using on the Docker container.

This is a prototype, so when I complete the project, I will share the source code on the other github repository.
